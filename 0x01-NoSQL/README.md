## NoSQL Databases

NoSQL (Not Only SQL) databases are a type of database management system that diverge from the traditional relational database model. They are designed to handle large volumes of unstructured or semi-structured data, providing high scalability and performance. Here are some key points about NoSQL databases:

- **Schema-less**: NoSQL databases do not enforce a fixed schema, allowing for flexible data models and easy scalability.
- **High Scalability**: NoSQL databases are designed to scale horizontally, meaning they can handle large amounts of data and high traffic loads.
- **Flexible Data Models**: NoSQL databases support various data models, such as key-value, document, columnar, and graph, allowing developers to choose the most suitable model for their application.
- **Distributed Architecture**: NoSQL databases are often distributed across multiple nodes, providing fault tolerance and high availability.
- **CAP Theorem**: NoSQL databases typically prioritize either consistency, availability, or partition tolerance, as defined by the CAP theorem.

Examples of popular NoSQL databases include MongoDB, Cassandra, Redis, and Neo4j.
